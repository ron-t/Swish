## Q&A file
### Q&A file format
Sample JSON file is here: https://github.com/ron-t/Swish/blob/master/SampleCourseOfflineJSON/inOutFiles/SampleFilesQA.json
- The same fields/data need to be provided, so a CSV version will look something like:

student id number|description|Q1 question|Q1 answer|Q2 question|Q2 answer|Qn question|Qn answer|
-----------------|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|
1111111|Assignment for Zac|What is X?|abc|What is Y?|123|What is Z?|11
2222222|Assignment for Ron|What is X?|def|What is Y?|456|What is Z?|22
3333333|Assignment for Steve|What is X?|ghi|What is Y?|789|What is Z?|33

- All values are text.
- One row per student.
- Two columns per question. Total number of columns is: 2 + (numQuestions * 2)


### Q&A file processing and validation
- [x] Determine file size limit.
  - Some investigation suggests upload filesize is around ~30MB, but that there is no clear documented limit: https://stackoverflow.com/a/8032280/3902950. Therefore, I have set the client-side limit to 15MB and added a notice that it is 15MB. 
- [x] Provide template CSV/Excel file.
  - Here: https://github.com/HexaCubist/Swish-UI/tree/master/samples-and-templates 
- [x] ~~Write code to convert CSV to JSON to be processble by [Swish logic](https://github.com/ron-t/Swish/tree/master/SampleCourseOfflineJSON) in [Create.js](https://github.com/ron-t/Swish/blob/master/SampleCourseOfflineJSON/Create.js) and [util.js](https://github.com/ron-t/Swish/blob/master/SampleCourseOfflineJSON/util.js)~~ (Not needed since SheetJS will convert CSV/Xls to JSON)

ðŸ¤” TODO: validation rules. E.g. an answer column exists for every question column; no empty cells (including empty string); ...

## Form fields validation
### Step one (field upload)
- [x] Replace the "If you're not sure how to make this file..." part with a link to the example input files: https://github.com/ron-t/Swish/tree/master/SwishUI/samples-and-templates
- [x] Include advice if an Excel file is uploaded: which sheet is used (always the first one?)

### Token
- [x] Must be provided.
- [x] Link to page with guide on how to generate a token: https://github.com/ron-t/Swish/tree/master/Documents
  - Other documentation/guides should be place here too. 

### Domain
- [x] Only allow 3 selectable options. Option 2 is default.
1. https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz
2. https://auckland.beta.instructure.com
3. https://auckland.test.instructure.com

### Course ID
- [x] Must be numeric.
- ~~(?) Must be valid. Not sure if this is worth checking.~~ 
  - **Not worth checking (other errors will occur if the course id is wrong).**
  - ~~Logic would be something like an async GET call to the [Canvas API](https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/doc/api/courses.html#method.courses.show) using the provided Token ; Endpoint: /api/v1/courses/:id ; Invalid if "unauthorised error" returned ; Valid if course data returned.~~

### Assignment title prefix
- [x] Must be provided.
- [x] Impose **254** character limit.

### Number of questions
- [x] Must be integer.
- [x] Should match the number of questions and answers provided in the uploaded file. Perhaps this could be automatically populated; if not, it would serve as a cross-check before submission.
  - Automatically populated

### Total marks
- [x] Must be numeric.

### Lock date time
- [x] Must be datetime.
- [x] Date format should be DD/MM/YYYY instead of MM/DD/YYYY.
- [x] Check that timezones are correct. I.e. the lock date time provided in the form is exactly the same as what appears on Canvas; it will still work when daylight savings changes for NZTime.
- [x] Explain that lock date will also be the due date.
- ~~[ ] Consider allowing a due date separate to lock date.~~

### Number of attempts
- [x] Must be numeric.
- [x] Leave blank for unlimited
- Note: the Canvas API uses -1 for unlimited attempts.


## Other issues
- [x] Remove "Derive marks per Q" field. Force marks to be evenly distributed across questions.
- [x] Change copyright ownership to Zac and Ron.
- [x] Add note crediting SEED Fund 2019 for enabling SwishUI to be created.
- [x] Consistent capitalisation or naming scheme for field names.
- [x] Add privacy policy. Use the text below. This means we must **not keep any logs** of any sort. And definitely **no click analytics** or any of that sort of thing :)

## [x] TODOs from 2019/08/01 meeting
~~Zac to:~~
1. ~~Investigate if SwishUI code can be entirely client-side.~~

~~Ron to:~~
1. ~~Change Swish logic to accept assignment description from JSON QA file.~~
   - ~~This will be done in the [Swish repo](https://github.com/ron-t/Swish/tree/master/SampleCourseOfflineJSON)~~
   - ~~[x] Changes to the JSON QA file format.~~
   - ~~[x] Changes to the quiz creation logic: where the description text is pulled from.~~
   - ~~(Private change) individualised URL generation logic.~~

2. ~~Add column to CSV for "description". This will mean:~~
     - ~~[x] CSV validation rules to match: total column count now 2 + (numQuestions * 2).~~

~~After this Zac can:~~

3. ~~Ensure CSV/xls to JSON conversion matches the [expected JSON QA format](https://github.com/ron-t/Swish/blob/master/SampleCourseOfflineJSON/inOutFiles/SampleFilesQA.json).~~

4. ~~"Module-ise" Swish logic.~~
